<h1> My Top Favorite Movies</h1>

<h3> The Lord of the Rings</h3>
<p> I love this movie because it's Tolkien.  I could really get into a lot of comments<br> about the flaws and errors, and to be honest, I couldn't even finish The Hobbit <br> but I still absolutely love the LotR trilogy. Minus the guy who plays Frodo, who drives me nuts.</p>

<h3> Um.  The Princess Bride</h3>
<p> Delightful, fun, hits all the proper elements, something for everyone and <br> full of eminently quotable sayings!</p>

<h3>Casablanca</h3>
<p> Been too long!  But I remember liking it.</p>
